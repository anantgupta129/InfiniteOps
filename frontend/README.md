# Serverless Deployment

## Description

This demonstrates how to deploy a model in a serverless environment using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. The model is trained using the Intel Image Classification dataset, and the goal is to deploy it in a way that allows for easy scaling and cost efficiency.

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed and configured
- AWS SAM CLI installed and configured
- Docker installed
- A trained model that you want to deploy
- The dependencies of your model must be packaged in a `requirements.txt` file

## Serverless Framework

https://www.serverless.com/

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
```
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```

After pushing the docker image to the ECR,specify the image URI in the `serverless.yaml`

<details>
<summary><b>serverless.yaml:</b></summary>

```bash
service: serverless-intel
 
provider:
  name: aws #cloud provider
  region: ap-south-1 #region (mumbai)
  memorySize: 3008 #memory usage
  timeout: 300 
 
functions:
  intel: 
    image: 294495367161.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/intel-serverless:latest

      - http:
          path: inference 
          method: post 
          cors: true
```

		"buildings"
	],
	"1": [
		"forest"

	"2": [
		"glacier"
	],

		"mountain"
	],
	"4": [
		"sea"
	],
	"5": [
		"street"
	]
}
```
</details>

## Create the Docker image 

```bash
docker build -t intel-serverless
```
For testing it out 

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 intel-serverless
```
After testing it out use the ECR to push the image to ECR using ECR Push Commands

Also make sure to add the Permissions to EC2 Role, itâ€™ll be needed by serverless

```bash

```
## Deploy
```bash
serverless deploy
```

# Serverless FrontEnd

```bash
yarn create next-app --experimental-app
```

```bash
yarn dev
```
